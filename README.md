### UML Diagram

For the fourth project in my OpenClassrooms course I was required to create a UML diagram to illustrate the technical architecture for a food delivery app called ExpressFood.  The UML diagram was a class diagram.  The UML class diagram was used to visually map out how the different areas of the database would be connected in an organized and intuitive way.  
### MySQL Database
MySQL was used to create the database for ExpressFood.  I used the UML class diagram as a map to design the database in a pre-planned, organized and efficient way.

### MySQL Example Queries To Access Database

The above image shows a few of the queries I had to create in order to show competency at querying databases using MySQL.  For this project I learned numerous way of querying using MySQL, from basic to complex queries by using keywords such as SELECT, JOIN, ON, WHERE, FROM, ect.  I also learned how to update, delete and add data using MySQL.
